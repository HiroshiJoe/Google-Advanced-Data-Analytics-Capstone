Predicting Employee Turnover This project uses machine learning to predict employee turnover at Salifort Motors. By analyzing employee data and building predictive models, I identified key factors driving turnover and provided recommendations to improve employee retention.

## Predicting Employee Turnover at Salifort Motors: Addressing Overwork & Improving Retention

This project tackles high employee turnover at Salifort Motors using machine learning. By analyzing employee data and building predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), I uncovered a critical insight: **employee overwork is a major driver of turnover.**

This repository details my analysis, model development, and key findings, culminating in actionable recommendations for Salifort's leadership. These recommendations focus on:

* **Workload Management:** Capping projects, promoting tenured employees, and reassessing overtime policies.
* **Work-Life Balance:** Rewarding output over excessive hours and clarifying expectations around workload and time off.
* **Company Culture:** Fostering open communication and addressing concerns about workload and evaluation fairness.

This project demonstrates my ability to translate data insights into strategic recommendations, providing Salifort with a roadmap to improve employee retention and create a more supportive work environment.
